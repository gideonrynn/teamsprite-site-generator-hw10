# Usage

The Team Sprite application allows a user to generate a webpage that displays information regarding members of a team based on prompts and stored user inputs using the command-line.

A project manager, department head or team lead can use the application to generate basic team details quickly for a website that can be referenced by stakeholders or boards without having to navigate to external profiles provided by each team member. This particular set of profiles is intended to build an engineering team.

When the command line prompts are complete, an index.html page will save to "output" folder.

The generated page will include the members of the team and:
- name
- title
- id
- role (manager, intern, engineer)
- depending on the role, github username, school, or office number
